# HL7-C-CDA-Task-Force-Examples
# These are some example C-CDAs created by Brett Marquard of WaveOne Associates.

## Not all samples have been approved by HL7 Example Task Force, so check out the http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=CDA_Example_Task_Force for current status. 

The reason why we include complete files above is so that we can validate the XML using industry standard tools, such as the NIST TT Validator. 

### Why?
*Lots* of people have implemented C-CDA and it's the primary document standard in MU2 and now MU3.

### Fine print
Samples posted here may not been approved by HL7 or any other body. They are educated guesses
